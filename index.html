   It is an open world action adventure with a multitude of missions in which we can play with three different characters: Trevor, Michael and Franklin. In addition, it has GTA Online, the online multiplayer mode of GTA 5 with many missions in which you create the character and you can play them, the character has its own level and money within the game, you can play in sessions of up to 30 players For each one, you can also only play with friends on your same platform since the game does not have crossplay (the ability to play with a different console than yours at the same time).
